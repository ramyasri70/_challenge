I approach this challenge using AWS CodeDeploy for which I create a seriverole with limitted user permissions using IAM role,  setting up IAM instance profile for Amazon EC2 instance.
For an EC2 instance running windows server, I would add inbound rule under Security groups that allows HTTP traffic with configured ports.
And then added  the html code in index.html file, application specific details for codeDeploy in appsec.yml file and a .bat file for the installation in the same folder.
Upload the application to S3 bucket and register the application with code deploy using create-application command.
Now use the CodeDeploy push command to deploy the application.
